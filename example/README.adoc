= Scalable, event-driven coffee shop

How to use event sourcing in several services with an event-driven architecture, Apache Kafka and Java EE.


== Run

. Start Apache Kafka brokers, e.g. using Docker compose: https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker[wurstmeister/kafka-docker^].
Configure the `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME` to your corresponding IP address.

. Configure each of the `kafka.properties` files with `bootstrap.servers=<your-IP>:9092`.

. Build and run the individual instances.
On each of the `orders/`, `beans/` and `barista/` directories, execute `build-run-local.sh`.
This builds the Gradle project, builds the Docker image and starts a new instance of the given service.


== Usage

The following will demonstrate the usage of the HTTP endpoints and example responses.

. In order to create coffee orders you have to add beans to the beans storage first:
----
$> curl http://localhost:8002/beans/resources/beans -i -XPOST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"beanOrigin": "Colombia", "amount": 10}'

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
X-Powered-By: Undertow/1
Server: WildFly/10
Date: Fri, 17 Nov 2017 20:49:26 GMT
----

. Check the creation of the beans:
----
$> curl http://localhost:8002/beans/resources/beans

{"Colombia":10}
----

. Create a new coffee order:
----
$> curl http://localhost:8001/orders/resources/orders/ -i -XPOST \
  -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"beanOrigin": "Colombia", "coffeeType": "Espresso"}'

HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Connection: keep-alive
X-Powered-By: Undertow/1
Server: WildFly/10
Location: http://localhost:8001/orders/resources/orders/c099c158-b748-4115-bed3-7b5dfff70771

----

. Check the creation of the coffee order using *your* `Location` header, for example:
----
$> curl http://localhost:8001/orders/resources/orders/c099c158-b748-4115-bed3-7b5dfff70771

{"status":"started","type":"espresso","beanOrigin":"Colombia"}
